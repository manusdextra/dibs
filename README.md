# Dibs

In my family, we write wishlists. Which is a brilliant idea because everyone gets what they want and no one has to think too hard. And with a long enough list, there are always surprises. The most frequent surprise is that of duplicate presents, which this pet project aims to address.

Besides the practical motivation, I made this to practice using Flask on a small-scale project. Ideally, this should be accomplished without resorting to JavaScript.

## Goals

- [ ] Users can be invited with just their email
- [ ] Users can create a wishlist item-by-item
- [ ] Users can comment on other's wishlists calling dibs on items
- [ ] Creators of a wishlist cannot see the comments made on them
